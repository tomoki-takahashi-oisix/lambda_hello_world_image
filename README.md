# lambda_hello_world_image

To create and push ecr and hello world image as dummy image easily and quickly

## Why

We create lambda more easily, when managing lambda using ecr by terraform, if we can use dummy image.

- If not so, we need to create lambda after creating ecr.
- If so, we can create both lambda and ecr as the same time.
